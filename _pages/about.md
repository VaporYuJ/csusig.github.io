Team Members
------
We have a dynamic and creative team consisting of professors, doctoral students, master's students, and undergraduate students. They come from diverse academic backgrounds and work together to address practical problems and advance the discipline.

Research Focus
======
Our research primarily revolves around fundamental software quality assurance and security in open-source operating system ecosystems, with a special emphasis on addressing software quality and security issues in fundamental software, cloud-native, and industrial network systems. Dr. Heyuan Shi has authored or co-authored over 20 papers published in renowned CCF-A/B category journals such as FSE, TSE, RTSS, ISSTA, EMSOFT, TCAD, and SANER, and holds 7 granted national invention patents.

Collaborations
======
CSUSIG maintains long-term collaborations with prestigious institutions such as the School of Software, Tsinghua University, the Alibaba Cloud Basic Software Operating System Department, and the DragonLizard Open Source Community. We welcome students and researchers to join our team and engage in meaningful collaborations.



Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
